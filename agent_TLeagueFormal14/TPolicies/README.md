# TPolicies
Policies used in various RL or IL applications.
Based on tf 1.x APIs.
In the style of `tf.contrib.layers` and `tf-slim`.
Some code of implementing policy gradient loss are borrowed from `deepmind/trfl` and `openai/baselines`.
Some code for transformer layer is borrowed from TODO!

## Install
cd to the folder and run the command:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Example
See the testing file `net_zoo/net_name/net_name_test.py` which can serve as examples.

## some notes
Use `tf.contrib.framework.nest`, e.g., `nest.flatten`, `nest.map_structure`.
It is helpful when, for example, computing losses from all the action heads.
